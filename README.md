This Project is our MVC Database First Learning Project for We Can Code It Bootcamp.
The user is able to add, delete, view, and edit a virtual closet. Focused on four types of clothing: Tops, Bottoms, Accessories, and Shoes.
Uniquely styled views add to the features. Including an updated navbar, and additional bootstrap components.
